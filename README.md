# Gyclean
By accepting the gas amount limit in the environment as 300, our green light continues to turn on until the gas amount reaches 300. If it exceeds 300, a warning will be given with a red light and a buzzer. In this process, the increasing amount of gas will be seen on the screen placed on our Arduino. However, if the amount of gas in the environment still does not decrease, our ventilation engine will activate and clean the amount of gas in the environment.
